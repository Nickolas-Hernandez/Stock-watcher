### Project Takeaways

As my first junior developer project, this app has taught me the importance of planning and considering how each peice of code will interact with other pieces. Looking back on this project I can easly find many places where better planning could have led to a cleaner, better structured code. I look forward to implementing better code design principles on future projects

**Other skills learned:**
* AJAX
* APIs
* Git Version Control
